🔒 About The Project

OmniLab is a proprietary, dual-state workspace designed for heavy-duty intellectual tasks. Unlike standard chatbots, it operates as a complete operating system for your workflow, switching between two distinct cognitive architectures based on your needs.

Privacy First: OmniLab runs entirely offline on your hardware using Ollama. Your code, research, and data never leave your machine.

⚡️ Cognitive States

OmniLab features two distinct modes, tailored for specific professional workflows.

🔴 Forge Mode

Engineered for Developers, Architects, and DevOps.

Feature

Description

🏗️ Blueprint Engine

Scaffolds entire file structures (folders, files, config) directly to your hard drive based on architectural prompts.

🩺 Diff Doctor

Analyzes your local git diff to detect bugs, security flaws, and generate commit messages before you push.

🛠️ Auto-Refactor

Context-aware suggestions to clean up, optimize, and modernize legacy codebases.

🔵 Nexus Mode

Designed for Researchers, Writers, and Analysts.

Feature

Description

⚡ Flashpoint

Instantly converts PDFs and notes into active recall flashcards for rapid learning in the Lab Bench.

🎙️ Podcast Protocol

Converts complex text and synthesis into audio, allowing you to "listen" to your research while multitasking.

🧠 Deep Context

Optimized vector search for synthesizing information across multiple large documents.

🧪 The Lab Bench

A dedicated split-screen artifact viewer that lives alongside your chat, ensuring you never lose context.

Live Preview: Renders HTML/CSS/JS instantly for web prototyping.

Code Review: Full-height syntax highlighting for comfortable reading.

Interactive Tools: Flip through Flashcards or view Synthesis Tables without switching windows.
